# Project Overview
We will be using data from the World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/), as found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report).
Our plan is to display the data using different visualizations to look at different aspects of the data. 

## Homepage Choropleth
The site homepage will use the Choropleth.js plugin to Leafleft to visualize the happiness score as a heatmap. This map has a slider to move through the different years of the data, as well as a layer control to change the heatmap to use the various factors that the World Happiness Report presents in their data set.

## Country Analysis/Visualization
To further find connections within the data, we looked at it on a country by country level; with a page of the website dedicated to a line graph and table where a selected country's data can be displayed. The line graph plots the score over time for the country, with the options to also plot the other factors from the dataset. There is also a table containing all the data for the selected country.

## Factor Analysis/Visualization
The World Happiness Report contains data that tells how much of an influence different factors (GDP per capita, generosity in the country, perception of government corruption, etc.) have on the Happiness Score. We use a scatter plot to see if there is any correlation between the influence of different factors and the Happiness Score. We can toggle between different years as well to see if these correlations hold up over time in the dataset as well.
